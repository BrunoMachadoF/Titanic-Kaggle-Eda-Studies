# 🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my solution to the classic [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which challenges participants to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic competition is one of the most popular entry-level projects in data science.  
The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question:

> **"What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?"**

The dataset provides demographic and socio-economic information such as **name, age, gender, ticket class, and family relations**, which can be used to train models.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Analyze missing values, distributions, and correlations.  
   - Visualize survival rates by features (sex, age, class, etc.).

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Handle missing values (imputation).  
   - Encode categorical variables.  
   - Create new features (family size, title extraction, etc.).

3. **Modeling**  
   - Train baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.  
   - Experiment with advanced models: Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM.  
   - Evaluate performance using accuracy.

4. **Submission**  
   - Generate CSV file with predictions.  
   - Submit to Kaggle and track performance on the leaderboard.

Do you want me to also create a **requirements.txt** file (with scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, etc.) to complement this README?
