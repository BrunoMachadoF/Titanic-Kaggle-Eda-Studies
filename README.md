# ðŸš¢ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my solution to the classic [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which challenges participants to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Titanic competition is one of the most popular entry-level projects in data science.  
The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question:

> **"What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?"**

The dataset provides demographic and socio-economic information such as **name, age, gender, ticket class, and family relations**, which can be used to train models.
